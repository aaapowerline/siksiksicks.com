          Sik Sik Sicks, formed in 2018 by
          <a class="bio__link" href="https://instagram.com/maddlucas"
            >Madd Lucas</a
          >, brings a fresh energy to the Southern California punk rock scene.
          Their 2019 debut EP, 'Homecoming Whore', produced by Paul Miner, mixes
          sharp guitar riffs and catchy pop hooks, influenced by the likes of
          Hole and Blondie, with the raw edge of 90s emo and grunge.

        <p class="bio__text">
          Playing iconic LA venues such as The Whiskey a Go Go and The Wiltern,
          they've become known for their dynamic performances and bold stance
          against cancel culture, especially with tracks like
          <a class="bio__link" href="#music-video">'Turn Off Your TV'</a>. Their
          collaboration with the Dwarves, including duets and music videos, has
          further solidified their presence in the punk rock world.

          The band, featuring Max Lucas on lead guitar, Dean Carpenter on bass,
          and Jona Bowen Smith on drums, delivers a powerful combination of
          teenage angst, dark humor, and provocative, catchy tunes, proving
          themselves as a significant force in today's punk rock landscape.
